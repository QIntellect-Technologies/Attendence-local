client_staff_leave_routes.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mobile self-service leave requests for office/field staff (client_staff rows).

Writes into the same Supabase `leave_requests` table the Client Dashboard's
Leave Management screen reads via support_db.list_client_leave_requests /
create_client_leave_request -- so a leave applied for on mobile appears on
the dashboard immediately (and manager/admin get the same notification a
dashboard-created leave would), with no separate mobile-only leave store.

Previously the mobile app called /apply_leave and /get_my_leaves. Neither
exists anywhere in app.py (grepped) -- every mobile leave request was
posting into a 404 and silently vanishing, the same class of bug
client_staff_attendance_routes.py fixed for attendance. This blueprint is
the fix for leave; register it alongside client_staff_attendance_bp.

Half-day model: half-day is a modifier that can apply to any leave category,
not a category of its own. A half-day submission keeps leave_type as the
category the user actually picked (Annual/Sick/...) and carries
half_day_period (first_half/second_half, derived from the picked time
window) plus the exact half_day_start_time/half_day_end_time as their own
fields on the row -- create_client_leave_request accepts these
independently of leave_type. This replaced an earlier scheme that
overwrote leave_type to the literal string 'half_day' and smuggled the
real category + time range through the free-text `reason` field; that
meant leave_type could never be trusted as "the category" for any
half-day row, and the attendance gate's half-day lookup
(support_db_attendance_gate._find_approved_half_day_leave) now matches on
half_day_period being set rather than leave_type=='half_day'.

org_id/branch_id/staff_id come from g.client_staff (verified JWT), never
from the request body -- same isolation guarantee /mark and /history
already give: a token minted for one staff member can't file or read leave
for anyone else by editing the payload or a query param, because there is
no such field to edit for those three values.

Visibility contract this route exists to preserve:
  - This mobile portal ALWAYS returns only the caller's own leave rows
    (list_client_leave_requests is called with user_id=g.client_staff['id']
    every time) -- even if the caller happens to also be someone's manager.
    A manager's team-wide view lives on the Client Dashboard
    (/api/leaves, team-scoped via client_dashboard_auth.get_team_scope_ids),
    a completely separate surface with its own token. This portal never
    exposes a teammate's leave, on purpose.

         decision (and an approved leave may already be feeding
         attendance/payroll), so changing it from there is a dashboard
