session_registry.py
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shared single source of truth for concurrent-session enforcement across
every JWT auth surface in this codebase:

    account_type            Minted/validated by
    ──────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    'internal_user'         support_auth.py           (Support Dashboard)
    'client_user'           client_dashboard_auth.py  (desktop, admin/HR)
    'client_staff'          client_dashboard_auth.py  (desktop, manager)
    'client_staff_mobile'   client_staff_auth.py      (mobile field portal)

Audit finding this closes: "No Session Invalidation — Unlimited Concurrent
Sessions" (Medium). Every JWT module above was otherwise fully stateless —
a validly signed, unexpired token was accepted forever, from as many
devices as someone logged in from, with no server-side way to end it early
(logout only cleared localStorage; the token itself stayed live until
natural expiry — 8h/12h/30d depending on surface).

Mechanism
---------
One row per (account_type, user_id) in `active_sessions` holds the single
session_id currently considered valid for that account. rotate_session()
overwrites that row with a fresh UUID at mint time and the caller embeds it
in the JWT as the 'sid' claim. validate_session() re-checks the token's
'sid' against that row on every authenticated request — a token whose
'sid' no longer matches is dead even though its signature/exp are fine.

This deliberately gives ONE valid session per account, not a per-device
session list with individual revocation — a full "view/revoke any active
session" UI was scoped and rejected as disproportionate for a Medium
finding whose reported behavior is "unlimited concurrent sessions with no
invalidation" (see the accompanying design discussion). If that changes,
this table's (account_type, user_id) primary key becomes the thing to widen
to a real session id, not a redesign of the call sites below.

'client_staff' and 'client_staff_mobile' are deliberately different
account_types even though they can both belong to the same underlying
client_staff row: a manager who is also a field worker must be able to stay
logged into the mobile app while their desktop dashboard session gets
superseded by a new desktop login, and vice versa. See
client_staff_auth.py's _mint_token docstring and end_all_client_staff_sessions()
below for the one place that deliberately kills both together.

Two distinct "you're logged out" reasons reach the client, because they
need different copy:
    SESSION_SUPERSEDED — someone (possibly you) logged in elsewhere, or you
                          logged out, or the row predates this rollout.
    PASSWORD_CHANGED   — your password was changed (by you or an admin);
                          your token is dead even though no one "logged in
                          elsewhere" in the ordinary sense.

Perf
----
Same shape as support_db_core.py's _compute_org_status: a short in-process
TTL cache in front of the Supabase read, safe ONLY because the Dockerfile
runs a single gunicorn worker (`--workers 1 --threads 4` — see the comment
in login_throttle.py for the same load-bearing assumption; a plain
in-memory dict would silently under-enforce with >1 worker). 5s here, not
_compute_org_status's 60s, because this is a security check, not a billing
check — a revoked session should stop working within single digits of
seconds, not up to a minute.

Deliberately does NOT import support_db_core, even though the caching
pattern mirrors it: support_db_core is intentionally not imported at
module top by client_dashboard_auth.py because it pulls in the full
Supabase/config chain before app.py is ready for it (see that module's
_org_access_blocked_response comment). session_registry is imported at
module top by all three auth modules, so importing support_db_core here
would reintroduce exactly the circular-import problem that comment warns
about. The ~15 lines of cache/retry logic below are duplicated on purpose
to avoid that coupling — if support_db_core's retry helper changes, this
module has no reason to change in lockstep with it anyway, since it talks
to a different table for a different purpose.

Fail-open posture: validate_session() fails OPEN on a transient Supabase
read error (a lookup blip must not lock every legitimate session out,
same posture as _compute_org_status). rotate_session/end_session/
invalidate_session are writes on the login/logout/admin-action path and
fail CLOSED (raise) — a login must never silently issue a token whose
session can never be validated, and a password-reset's session kill must
never silently no-op.
