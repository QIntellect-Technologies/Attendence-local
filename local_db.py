    installed local node pick up new columns on next start, with zero
    manual migration step at any client site.

    check_in_confirmed / check_out_confirmed: per-leg "was the value
    currently stored in marked_at / check_out_marked_at actually captured
    inside its shift window" flags — see record_attendance_local. DEFAULT 1
    so pre-existing rows (written before this migration) are treated as
    already finalized and never silently reopened for reconfirmation;
    every new row/update this function's caller writes sets the real value
    explicitly.

    notes: operator-facing free text set by record_attendance_local for
    the "detected early, never seen again inside the shift window, only
    confirmed once it closed" case — see _format_early_before_shift_note.
    Also used for the checkout-leg early/late held-review case — see
    _format_checkout_hold_note. NULL for every other row; no default
    needed.

    check_out_hold_reason: 'early' | 'late' | NULL. Set only while a
    checkout sighting sits in held_for_review (check_out_confirmed=0,
    check_out_marked_at holding the informative-but-unconfirmed sighting
    time) — see record_attendance_local's checkout branch. Cleared back to
    NULL by whichever operator resolution action (confirm_held_checkouts /
    mark_held_checkouts_half_day / leave_held_checkouts_open) resolves the
    row, so its presence alone tells the review screen "this row still
    needs a checkout decision" without a separate flag.

    branch_id: SECURITY-RELEVANT retrofit. attendance_buffer previously had
    NO branch scoping at all — every query matched purely on
    (people_type, person_code, attendance_date), and local_event_id was
    just f"{people_type}:{person_code}:{today}". Since this SQLite file
    lives at one fixed path per machine (config_store.DB_PATH) regardless
    of which branch is currently activated, reactivating a machine for a
    DIFFERENT branch made every read/write here silently operate across
    branches — a stale row from a previous branch with the same
    people_type+person_code (very plausible with small numeric codes like
    "0001") would be read, shown in held-review, and even overwritten by
    the new branch's detections. DEFAULT '' means every row written before
    this migration is retroactively "no branch" — which never matches a
    real (non-empty Supabase UUID) branch_id in any query below, so it's
    automatically and permanently excluded from every branch-scoped query
    without a destructive DELETE. It is NOT backfilled to the current
    branch_id, since a mixed-branch machine could have rows from more than
    one branch and there's no way to tell them apart after the fact —
    quarantining beats guessing. These orphaned '' rows are otherwise

    activation.activate_with_token() whenever a machine activates for a
    branch different from whatever it was previously configured for (or is
    activating for the very first time) — see that function's comment for
    the exact "reset vs. preserve" decision.

    Why this exists on top of branch_id scoping (see
    _ensure_schema_migrations' branch_id docstring): since this machine's
    SQLite file lives at one fixed path regardless of which branch is
    currently activated (config_store.DB_PATH), branch_id scoping stops a
    reactivated machine's OLD data from ever being READ or WRITTEN
    across branches — but on its own it just quarantines that old data
    forever rather than removing it. For a machine being redeployed to a
    genuinely different client/branch (returned hardware, support
    reimaging a device, a client's exe reused on new premises), the
    correct behavior isn't "keep it quarantined indefinitely", it's "this
    machine has no business holding that data at all anymore" —
    activation is the one moment that's unambiguously true, so that's
    where the actual wipe belongs. Branch scoping remains as defense in
    depth for any path that reaches attendance_buffer without going
    through activation (there isn't one today, but a future refactor
    could introduce one without realizing this guarantee depended on it).

    Uses DROP + recreate (via init_db()) rather than DELETE FROM, so the
    recreated schema is always exactly current — no lingering columns from
    whatever schema-migration state the previous branch's install had
    reached. Does NOT touch config_store's own JSON config file; that's a
    separate concern already fully overwritten by save_config() in the
    same activation flow.

    """Capture a raw presence detection for today, deciding INTERNALLY
    whether it's a check-in or check-out attempt and whether it lands
    inside that leg's shift window — see local_node.shift_gate. This used
    to be the caller's job (camera_stream_manager pre-computed a leg via
    attendance_leg_for_today, purely from "does a row exist yet", then
    passed in a precomputed outside_shift bool). That was wrong: it let
    whichever detection happened to arrive FIRST claim the check-in slot,
    even if it was outside the shift window — so a legitimate, in-window
    arrival that showed up after an early false/loitering detection got
    filed as a check-OUT attempt instead, and the real check-in was lost.
    Folding the decision in here, atomically with the write, fixes that:
    a slot is only ever CONFIRMED by a detection that actually falls
    inside its own window.

    Per-leg state machine (check_in_confirmed / check_out_confirmed):

    · No row yet, or check-in was never confirmed and no checkout has
      happened yet -> this is a check-in ATTEMPT.
        - inside check-in window  -> confirms the check-in. marked_at is
          this detection's time, check_in_confirmed=1, sync_status=pending.
          This is "the first detection IN the shift timing".
        - outside the window, window NOT YET OPEN (early stray) -> held
          candidate. marked_at tracks the most recent such sighting
          (informative for review) but check_in_confirmed stays 0, so a
          later in-window detection can still claim the slot instead of
          being misfiled as a checkout.
        - outside the window, window ALREADY CLOSED (genuinely late) ->
          two different outcomes depending on whether this person was
          ALSO seen earlier that day, before the window even opened:
            · no earlier stray -> HOLDS for an operator decision (confirm
              as check-in, or mark half-day) rather than auto-confirming.
              This is the first (and possibly only) sighting this person
              gets today, and it's genuinely ambiguous whether it should
              count — see confirm_held_check_ins / mark_held_check_ins_half_day.
            · an earlier too-early stray WAS already seen (this is the
              row's second sighting today) -> auto-CONFIRMS on this
              detection instead of holding. The early stray is already
              proof the person was on site before the shift even started,
              so there's no real decision left for an operator to make —
              confirming immediately also lets the row transition to
              checkout tracking right away instead of sitting in
              held-for-review purgatory. marked_at becomes this (late)
              detection's time, and notes records the earlier early
              sighting for context (see _format_late_check_in_note's
              held=False wording). Either way, leaving a genuinely-first
              late sighting unconfirmed would strand the person in
              check-in-attempt purgatory for the rest of the day, never
              transitioning to checkout tracking at all. See
              shift_gate.is_check_in_window_closed.

    · Check-in already confirmed -> this is a check-out ATTEMPT.
        - inside check-out window -> check_out_marked_at = this detection's
          time, check_out_confirmed=1, check_out_hold_reason cleared,
          sync_status=pending. Every in-window sighting keeps overwriting
          it, so the LAST detection inside the checkout window is what
          ends up stored, per spec.
        - outside the window, and a checkout is ALREADY confirmed -> the
          row is left completely untouched (event_type=stray_ignored, no
          write at all). Without this, a person re-appearing on camera
          hours after a valid checkout (hallway walk-through, camera
          glitch) would silently overwrite their real checkout with a
          bogus one just for being the most recent sighting.
        - outside the window, no confirmed checkout yet -> HELD for
          review rather than silently discarded. check_out_marked_at
          tracks the most recent such sighting (informative only —
          check_out_confirmed stays 0, so this never syncs as a real
          checkout on its own), check_out_hold_reason records which side
          of the window it missed ('early' — seen before the window
          opened, likely left early; or 'late' — seen after it closed,
          likely stayed late/forgot to check out), and notes captures a
          human-readable timestamp via _format_checkout_hold_note.
          sync_status=held_for_review, so — same as a held check-in — it
          is invisible to the live feed and the normal auto-sync loop
          until an operator resolves it via one of:
            · confirm_held_checkouts    — accept the sighted time as the
              real checkout (either early or late reason).
            · mark_held_checkouts_half_day — early reason only: clear the
              checkout, keep the note, flag the day status='half_day'.
            · leave_held_checkouts_open   — late reason only: clear the
              checkout, keep the note, leave status as-is (no checkout
              recorded for the day, but the note explains why).
          Held rows carry no date-based expiry (same invariant as held
          check-ins) — they persist across days, unresolved, until an
          operator acts or explicitly syncs them as-is.

    A manual_override row is always authoritative and short-circuits all
    of the above, unchanged from before.
