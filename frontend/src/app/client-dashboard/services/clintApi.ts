 * clientApi.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Shared low-level HTTP plumbing for client-dashboard pages that talk to
 * Flask's /api/client/* routes (Settings.tsx, OnboardingWizard.tsx, and any
 * future client-scoped page).
 *
 * Scope note: this module intentionally does NOT export domain types like
 * BootstrapResponse, Branch, GroupItem, etc. Settings.tsx and
 * OnboardingWizard.tsx have genuinely different shapes for those (e.g.
 * personFamily is required post-onboarding but optional during onboarding).
 * Forcing a single shared domain type across both would either loosen
 * Settings' stricter guarantees or require fighting generics to reconcile
 * fields that mean different things in each flow. Sharing only the fetch/auth
 * layer avoids that false-DRY trap while still eliminating the real
 * duplication: both files previously carried byte-identical copies of
 * getClientAuthToken/fetchClientJson, and both had the same bug in
 * loadClientBootstrap (a guaranteed-to-400 bare call before falling back to
 * the org_id-qualified one).
