client_staff_overtime_routes.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mobile self-service overtime requests for office/field staff (client_staff rows).

Mirrors client_staff_leave_routes.py exactly:

  - Writes into the same Supabase `overtime_requests` table the Client
    Dashboard's Overtime Management screen reads via
    support_db.list_client_overtime_requests / create_client_overtime_request
    (app.py's /api/overtime GET/POST), so a request submitted on mobile
    appears on the dashboard immediately, under the same manager/admin
    scoping (get_team_scope_ids + filter_rows_by_scope) the dashboard
    already applies to that endpoint -- nothing new to build there.

  - The mobile app previously called /api/overtime/request and
    /api/overtime/my. Neither exists anywhere in app.py (grepped) -- every
    mobile overtime request was posting into a 404 and silently vanishing,
    the same class of bug client_staff_leave_routes.py fixed for leave.
    This blueprint is that fix for overtime.

  - org_id/branch_id/staff_id come from g.client_staff (verified JWT),
    never from the request body/query string -- same isolation guarantee
    /leaves and /mark|/history already give: a token minted for one staff
    member can't file or read overtime for anyone else by editing the
    payload or a query param, because there is no such field to edit for
    those three values.

Visibility contract this route exists to preserve (per product decision):
  - This mobile portal ALWAYS returns only the caller's own overtime rows
    (list_client_overtime_requests is called with
    user_id=g.client_staff['id'] every time) -- even if the caller happens
    to also be someone's manager. A manager's team-wide view, and the
    admin's org-wide view, both live on the Client Dashboard's Overtime
    Management screen (/api/overtime, team-scoped via
    client_dashboard_auth.get_team_scope_ids for managers, unscoped for
    admins) -- a completely separate surface with its own token. This
    portal never exposes a teammate's overtime, on purpose. In short:
    one person's overtime IS visible to the admin dashboard and to their
    reporting manager's dashboard view, but never inside another
    individual staff member's mobile "My Overtime" list.

staff_id/org_id/branch_id are all UUID strings end-to-end (Supabase ids),
never coerced to int -- create_client_overtime_request/
list_client_overtime_requests in support_db.py already treat them as
opaque text, so this route just passes the JWT's string values straight
through without any int() cast that would break on a UUID.
