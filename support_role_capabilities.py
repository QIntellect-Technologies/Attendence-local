───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Support Dashboard role capabilities.

Two roles only. Anything not listed for a role is denied.

  super_admin — full control of the support platform
  billing     — invoices, plus read access to organizations for context

Billing deliberately gets orgs:read but not orgs:write/lifecycle: an invoice
is meaningless without knowing which customer it belongs to, but marking an
invoice paid already restores a suspended org, so billing never needs
archive/restore to unblock a client.

Mirrors role_permissions.py on the client side. The nav gate in
SupportLayout.tsx echoes this map for display; THIS FILE is the enforcement
point — a hidden nav item is a UX nicety, the capability check is the control.
