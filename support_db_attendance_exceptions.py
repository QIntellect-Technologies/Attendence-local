support_db_attendance_exceptions.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Turns a raw timing classification (early / on_time / late / overtime /
unscheduled — from support_db_attendance_gate.resolve_check_in_status /
resolve_check_out_status) into what actually gets WRITTEN to the attendance
row, plus the admin-notification side effect, for both write paths that
share this logic: mark_client_staff_attendance (mobile) and
record_cloud_camera_attendance (cloud camera).

Scenario contract (exactly as specified):
  Check-in
    early    -> checked in; notes say so; status = 'early' (informational,
                no admin action needed)
    on_time  -> checked in; status = 'on_time'
    late     -> checked in (attendance row DOES exist), but check_in_confirmed
                is left False and check_in_hold_reason='late' until an admin
                resolves it (present-but-late vs half_day vs short_leave) via
                resolve_attendance_exception. Admin notified.

  Check-out
    on_time  -> checked out; status = 'on_time'
    early    -> checked out, but check_out_hold_reason='early' until an
                admin decides early_leave vs half_day vs short_leave.
                Admin notified.
    late     -> checked out, but check_out_hold_reason='late' until an admin
                decides late vs overtime. Admin notified.
    overtime -> already-approved overtime covers this checkout — recorded
                normally, no hold, no notification (nothing for an admin to
                decide; the overtime request was already approved).

short_leave vs early_leave/half_day: early_leave means the person simply
left early with no prior arrangement; half_day means enough of the shift
was missed that it reads as a half-day absence. short_leave is neither —
it's a manager-sanctioned shorter attendance (arranged in advance, at the
manager's discretion), so it's tracked as its own distinct decision/status
rather than folded into either of the other two. Like half_day and
overtime, resolving to short_leave is only a CLASSIFICATION here — whether
it actually affects payroll is a separate, later decision (see the
payroll-decision columns/Phase 3 admin screen), not decided by this module.

Notifications are broadcast to every active admin/hr in the org (see
support_db_notifications._active_admin_recipient_ids) and are soft-fail: a
notification failure never blocks the attendance write itself.

#
# A DIFFERENT query/action pair from list_pending_exceptions/
# resolve_attendance_exception above, on purpose. Those two handle rows
# still AWAITING classification (a hold_reason is set, day_status isn't
# decided yet). The functions below handle the opposite case: the local
# node already classified the row (an operator resolved it on-device
# before syncing — see push_node_attendance / local_db.py's
# mark_held_*_half_day/short_leave/late/overtime), so there's nothing left
# to classify. What's still missing is the SEPARATE payroll question: does
# this classified day actually count against payroll or not.
#
# A local-node day_status is one value for the whole day — the node has no
# independent check-in-leg/check-out-leg decision the way the cloud
# exceptions flow does (see resolve_attendance_exception's leg param) — so
# there's only ever one decision to make per row, and it's always written
# to check_out_payroll_decision, the column get_staff_attendance_for_
# payroll_period/payroll_engine already read. check_in_payroll_decision is
# reserved for the cloud/mobile exceptions flow, where check-in and
# check-out can each independently need a decision, and is left untouched
# for local-node rows.

    for mobile/cloud), so this only ever sets a payroll-decision field
    (+ appends a note) — it never touches day_status, check_out_status, or
    either hold_reason column.

    decision: 'include' | 'exclude'. Raises ValueError for an invalid
    decision, a row not owned by this org, a row whose capture channel
    doesn't support a payroll decision, or a row with no resolved
    classification yet (nothing to decide on).

    Which column the decision is written to depends on WHICH leg the
    classification came from, not the capture channel:
      - local_node: always check_out_payroll_decision -- the node has one
        day_status for the whole day, so there's only ever one decision to
        make per row (see the module-level comment near

        is a check-IN-side classification (a confirmed-late arrival),
        independent of any check-out-side outcome the same row might also
        carry.
      - mobile_app, everything else (half_day/short_leave/overtime):
        check_out_payroll_decision, same as before.

    For a 'short_leave' or 'overtime' row (either channel now -- see
    create_short_leave_adjustment/create_overtime_adjustment), this also
    approves (decision='include') or rejects (decision='exclude') the
    linked leave_requests/overtime_requests row those functions created --
    that linked row's own status is what get_approved_leaves_for_payroll_
    period / get_approved_overtime_hours_for_payroll_period actually read,
    so the include/exclude call has to reach it, not just this attendance
    row's own payroll-decision column. 'late' has no linked row by design
    (see create_short_leave_adjustment's module-level rationale) -- the
    column write alone is the full effect for that case, feeding the org's
    lateComingPolicy occurrence count. 'half_day' also has no linked-row
    sync here: its leave is auto-approved at creation time and the
    deduction is governed entirely by this attendance row's own decision
    (see create_half_day_adjustment's docstring).
