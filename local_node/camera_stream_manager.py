local_node/camera_stream_manager.py

Continuous, per-camera RTSP reader shared by:
  - the live MJPEG preview grid in the node UI (ui_server.py)
  - real-time face recognition / attendance marking

Replaces camera_worker.py's cycle-based approach (open RTSP, read N frames,
close, repeat every poll interval). That approach re-opened the RTSP/NVR
connection every cycle and left nothing for a live UI to render between
cycles. A single persistent reader thread per camera keeps one connection
open, runs detection continuously, and always has a fresh frame ready for
the MJPEG endpoint — one source of truth per camera, not two divergent
capture loops for "watch it" vs. "recognize on it".

Reader/processor split
-----------------------
Frame acquisition (this thread's _run_reader) and frame processing
(_run_processor: detection + JPEG encode) run on two SEPARATE threads per
camera, not one. Face detection is CPU-bound and takes real time (hundreds
of ms on CPU-only hardware) — if that work ran inline in the same loop
that calls cap.read(), the RTSP source keeps buffering new frames on the
network faster than the loop drains them while detection blocks it, so
cap.read() returns progressively staler frames and the stream falls
further behind live over time (it never catches up). The reader thread's
only job is to keep draining the capture as fast as possible into
`state.raw_frame`, so cv2's own buffer never has anywhere to accumulate a
backlog. The processor thread reads whatever frame is currently freshest,
at its own pace, without ever holding up the reader.

No on-video match overlay is drawn — the live feed always shows the plain
camera image. Attendance marking and the live-events snapshot/confidence
still fire normally on a match; only the green box is intentionally absent.

        does not say what resolution the NVR really serves.
      * source FPS — the reader decodes every frame the camera sends,
        regardless of STREAM_FPS_LIMIT, which only throttles the display
        and detection side. A 30fps source is 2.5x the decode work of a

        decode and still returns an opened capture, so the request

            # arrive a second later. That is what was causing marks to
            # go missing rather than merely being late.
