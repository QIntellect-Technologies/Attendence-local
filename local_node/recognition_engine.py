"""
Self-contained face recognition entry point for the local node.

This module is intentionally thin. All model loading, detection, and
embedding extraction logic lives in shared_face_engine (bundled into this
node's Nuitka build — see local_node/build/build.py), so Trainer Desktop
and Local Node are guaranteed to always use the same model version,
detection threshold, and quality scoring. Only the local-node-specific
concern lives here: getting the Nuitka-bundled ONNX weights out of the
onefile bundle and into a persistent, writable app-data directory before
shared_face_engine ever tries to load them.
