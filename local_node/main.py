# print(...) or sys.stdout.write(...) unconditionally — cv2 and onnxruntime
# both do this for certain warnings — hits `AttributeError: 'NoneType'
# object has no attribute 'write'` on that call, which is unhandled and
# kills the whole process. This must run before cv2 (or anything else) is
# imported. Console builds (--console / Nuitka's --windows-console-mode=
# force) are unaffected: sys.stdout/stderr are real streams there, so this
# is a no-op for them. All actual diagnostics still go to LOG_DIR/node.log
# via logging_config.setup_logging() regardless of console state — this

# OpenCV parallelizes individual calls (resize, cvtColor, imencode, ...)
# across its own internal thread pool, sized to the machine's full core
# count by default. That's the right default for a single-threaded script
# calling cv2 once at a time — it is actively harmful here, where 5+
# camera reader/processor/detector threads are ALREADY the source of
# concurrency and are each calling cv2 functions independently. Left at
# its default, every one of those calls spawns its own wave of internal
# worker threads on top of the app's own threads, and all of them then
# fight over the same physical cores — this is a large, easy-to-miss
# contributor to a multi-camera box pinning near 100% CPU well before the
# GPU (which does the actual face detection/recognition math) is even
# close to saturated. Setting this to 1 tells OpenCV "don't parallelize
# yourself, the caller already handles concurrency" — each cv2 call now
# just runs on the thread that called it, which is exactly what we want
# when that thread is one of several already doing useful work in
# parallel. Must run before any camera/detector threads start.
