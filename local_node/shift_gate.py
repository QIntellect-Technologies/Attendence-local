"""
local_node/shift_gate.py

Real-time shift gate for local face-recognition attendance.

Checks two tiers, same precedence order as support_db_attendance_gate.py's
cloud-side resolve_timing_source: a per-staff personal shift override first
(tier 2, client_staff.shift_id_ref, synced down as config["staff_shift_windows"]
keyed by "people_type:person_code"), falling back to the branch's default
shift per people_type (tiers 4/5, config["shift_windows"][people_type]) when
no personal override is synced for that person. Department-level overrides
(tier 3) are still not supported locally and fall through to the branch
default like before.

This gate only decides whether a detection should HOLD locally for manual
review, not the final status — the backend still re-resolves the precise
per-staff status (on_time/late/early/unscheduled) when the record syncs.

CRITICAL BEHAVIOR: Shift Gating Fallback Strategy
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
When NO shift window is found for a person:

  1. If shift_mode_enabled=True (shifts ARE being used on this branch):
     → Return False (mark detection as OUTSIDE shift, hold for review)
     This is the safe default when shift timing rules apply but config
     is missing or sync failed — better to hold and require manual review
     than to silently accept out-of-hours detections.

  2. If shift_mode_enabled=False (shifts are NOT configured):
     → Return True (accept detection, backward-compatible behavior)
     Branches using simple mode or no attendance timing at all don't want
     detections held just because shift_windows are empty.

This dual behavior prevents two classes of bugs:
  - Sync failure: If shift_windows fails to sync but shift mode is active,
    we don't silently accept pre-shift detections (10:04 when shift is 10:10).
  - Configuration drift: If shift mode is disabled but old shift data lingers,
    we don't incorrectly hold all detections.
