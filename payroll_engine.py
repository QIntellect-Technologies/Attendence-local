Computes the itemized payroll breakdown (deductions + additions) for one
staff member over one pay period, from real attendance + leave data and the
org's configurable PayrollPolicy (see support_db.get_payroll_policy).

Consumes already-grouped, period-bounded data — see
support_db.get_staff_attendance_for_payroll_period /
get_approved_leaves_for_payroll_period. This module has no DB access of its
own, only computation, so it's trivially unit-testable without a Supabase
connection.
