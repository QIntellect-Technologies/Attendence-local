client_dashboard_auth.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
JWT auth for the desktop Client Dashboard (org-admin/HR/manager audience).

Two tables can log into this dashboard today — client_users (admin/HR
accounts) and client_staff (e.g. a manager given dashboard access under
their "Manager" hat, per StaffManagement's dashboard toggle). Both go
through this ONE module so a route enforcing team-scope doesn't need to
know which table the caller came from — it just reads g.dashboard_user.

Deliberately separate from:
  client_staff_auth.py   -> mobile employee/field-staff portal (different
                             audience, different secret: CLIENT_STAFF_JWT_SECRET)
  support_auth.py         -> internal Support Dashboard (internal_users)

  Token                  Signed with                  Identifies

  Client Dashboard       CLIENT_DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET   client_users OR
  token                                                client_staff, desktop
                                                        audience, org+branch
                                                        scoped
  Client staff (mobile)  CLIENT_STAFF_JWT_SECRET       client_staff, mobile
  token                                                audience only
  Support token          SUPPORT_JWT_SECRET            internal_users

Three separate secrets on purpose — a leaked token from one surface must
never be replayable against another. Never reuse one of these envs for
another module.

Row-scope contract this token exists to enforce:
  dashboard_scope == 'branch' -> route sees everything in org_id/branch_id,
                                  same as today, no filtering added.
  dashboard_scope == 'team'   -> route MUST intersect its result set against
                                  get_team_scope_ids(payload) before
                                  returning anything. The token carries
                                  staff_id (sub) + manager tree membership
                                  is resolved server-side per request via
                                  support_db_hierarchy.get_subordinate_ids —
                                  never trust a client-supplied staff/user id
                                  list for this.
  Payroll / salary routes ignore dashboard_scope entirely (unscoped) even
  for 'team' accounts — a manager's reporting-hierarchy visibility is not
  the same grant as compensation visibility. Enforce that at the route,
  not here; this module only tells you WHO is asking.

Flow:
  POST /api/login                  -> verify credentials (client_users OR
                                       client_staff) -> signed JWT, returned
                                       alongside the existing user payload.
  @require_client_dashboard_auth   -> decorator validating JWT on every
                                       subsequent dashboard request, sets
                                       g.dashboard_user.

Rollout note: existing sessions have no token (pre-migration localStorage).
Routes wrapped with @require_client_dashboard_auth will 401 those sessions
until they re-login — this was the agreed trade (forced one-time re-login),
not a bug.

    applies to client_staff-as-manager accounts).

    None means "do not filter" — callers must treat None as "no
