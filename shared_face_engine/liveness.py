ACTIVE liveness: verify that the thing in front of the camera performed a
randomly-chosen head movement, across a burst of frames, right now.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY THIS REPLACES THE FFT CHECK IN spoof.py
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
spoof.py measures the ratio of high- to low-frequency FFT energy in the
face crop, on the theory that real skin carries more fine texture than a
printed photo. That theory does not survive contact with real capture
hardware, because the metric is dominated by sharpness and exposure
rather than by liveness. Measured on synthetic controls matched for
content:

    LIVE face, good light      ratio = 2.04
    LIVE face, dim/backlit     ratio = 2.06
    LIVE face, motion blur     ratio = 0.20
    PRINTED PHOTO, sharp       ratio = 2.37   <-- highest of all
    SCREEN replay (moire)      ratio = 2.12   <-- second highest

The attack samples score ABOVE the genuine ones. A print is sharpened by
the print-and-recapture cycle, and a screen adds its own pixel-grid
high-frequency energy, while a real face indoors is dim and slightly
motion-blurred. So the two distributions do not merely overlap, they are
ordered the wrong way round.

That is why no threshold worked. Any cutoff strict enough to reject the
photo (>2.37) rejects every live face; any cutoff loose enough to admit
live faces (<2.04) admits the photo and the screen replay. Enabling the
check locked out real staff; disabling it let a photo through. Both
observations were correct, and neither was a tuning problem.

Movement is a different signal entirely, and it is one a flat artifact
cannot produce. A printed photo cannot turn its head. A still image on a
phone screen cannot either. Replaying a pre-recorded video can, which is
why the direction is chosen SERVER-SIDE per attempt and is not knowable
to the client in advance — an attacker would need footage of the target
performing the specific requested motion, prepared before they knew what
would be asked.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOW YAW IS MEASURED WITHOUT LOADING A NEW MODEL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
model_loader.py restricts InsightFace to allowed_modules =
["detection", "recognition"], so landmark_3d_68 is not loaded and
`face.pose` is unavailable. Loading it would add a model to every
consumer of the shared engine, including Local Node, for one route's
benefit.

The detection model (det_10g) already returns 5 keypoints per face —
left eye, right eye, nose tip, left mouth corner, right mouth corner —
at no extra cost, since FaceAnalysis.get() produces them in the same
forward pass that produces the embedding. Horizontal yaw follows from
where the nose sits between the eyes:

    yaw_ratio = (nose.x - eye_midpoint.x) / interocular_distance

Normalising by interocular distance makes this invariant to how far the
subject is from the lens and to image resolution, which a raw pixel
offset would not be. Facing the camera puts the nose near the eye
midpoint (~0.0); turning the head drives it toward the trailing eye.
This is a proxy, not a calibrated pose angle, and it does not need to be
anything more — the check is "did this ratio move a long way and come
back", which is a relative measurement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MIRRORING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Front-camera captures may or may not be horizontally flipped depending on
platform and plugin version, which would invert left from right and cause
false rejections. The app normalises this before upload by un-mirroring
front-lens captures (see face_verification_screen.dart), so the frames
arriving here are always in true orientation.

That normalisation is safe to leave client-side even though nothing else
about the liveness decision is: flipping an image horizontally cannot
manufacture head motion that did not occur. An attacker who flips their
frames still has to produce a real excursion in the ratio, and the
excursion is what is being checked. Contrast with the match verdict
itself, which is exactly the kind of claim a device must never be
allowed to assert — see this module's callers in
client_field_attendance_routes.py.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT STOP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stops: printed photos, still images displayed on a screen, a colleague
holding up the enrolled employee's photo — the entire class of attack
that motivated the original report.

Does not fully stop: a determined attacker replaying video of the target
that happens to contain the requested motion, or a real-time deepfake
puppet. Raising the bar there needs a trained PAD model (MiniFASNet /
Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing, ~2MB ONNX, loadable through the existing
onnxruntime dependency) run alongside this, not instead of it. Passive
texture models and active challenges fail to different attacks, which is
why production systems run both.
