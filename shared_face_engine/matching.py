"""
shared_face_engine/matching.py

Embedding aggregation and comparison, shared by every consumer that needs
to turn one-or-more stored embeddings into a match decision:

- Trainer Desktop        (aggregates embeddings after enrollment, optionally)
- Local Node              (recognition_worker.best_match against SQLite embeddings)
- Backend / app.py        (CameraStreamReader, /api/recognize/*, against
                            legacy SQLite embeddings AND Supabase embeddings)

This existed as three near-identical re-implementations before
(face_processor.compute_aggregate_embedding/compare_embeddings, whatever
local_node/recognition_worker.py does internally, and the cosine-similarity
helper in an earlier cloud worker draft). Centralizing it here means a
future change to the matching algorithm (threshold, distance metric,
per-vector weighting) only has to happen once, and training/recognition can
never silently drift apart the way the two separate InsightFace singletons
in shared_face_engine vs. face_processor.py did.
