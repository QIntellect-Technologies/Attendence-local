# this app than raw CPU cost: an attendance system that quietly stops
# noticing people who aren't standing close to the camera is a worse
# outcome than a busier CPU. If a CPU-only box needs to trade range for
# speed, that should be a deliberate per-install decision (e.g. an env

    GPU case: the GPU carries the actual matrix math, so ONNX's CPU
    thread pool only needs enough headroom for the pre/post-processing
    around it (resize, anchor decode, NMS, alignment) — and it has to
    stay SMALL, because it's competing with every other camera's
    reader/processor/detector threads for the same physical cores. 2 is
    the value that was field-tested against a real 90%+ CPU box with
    several GPU-accelerated cameras running (see model_loader history) —
    it isn't a rough guess.

    CPU-only case: there's no GPU to lean on, so onnxruntime's CPU
    execution provider IS the inference engine, and it should get most
    of the machine. It doesn't need to reserve room for a second
    simultaneous inference, though — every camera's detection call is
    serialized through embedding.py's _inference_lock, so at most ONE
    inference runs at any instant regardless of camera count. What it
    does need to leave alone is a couple of cores for the concurrently
    running reader/processor threads of the OTHER cameras (RTSP decode,
    resize, JPEG encode don't stop just because this camera is the one
